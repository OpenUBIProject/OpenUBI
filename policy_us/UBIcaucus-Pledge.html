<h3>#UBIcaucus Member Pledge:</h3>

If elected, I pledge to introduce legislation that can be passed by the House, Senate and signed into law by the President in the first quarter of 2021 that transparently funds and guarantees a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for the citizens of the United States of America, at a rate which covers basic human needs in an effort to eliminate poverty, while building a robust national economy.
